Angular JS
==========

Namespace = Module
Controller = Controller
Method = Function
ViewModel = $scope  #any variable with $ is a built in variable to angular, bad practice to name custom variables with $
Factory/Service - reusable logic
Routing - load a screen / view
Views

UI Router has better routing than angular (today)


$routeParams is a built in variable to grab the route url

app.factory('customerService')
